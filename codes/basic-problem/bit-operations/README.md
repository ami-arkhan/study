## Learn:
- Endianness:
  - [x] In desktop pc's numbers are stored as little endian. That is least significant bytes are stored at the beginning. But in network numbers are stored as big endian. The is most significant butes are stored at the beginning.
    - 0x1234 => 34 12 (little endian)
    - 0x1234 => 12 34 (big endian)

  - [x] Converting from little endian to big endian and vice-versa.

- XOR Operations:
  - [x] Exchanging values without temporary variable.
  - [x] Same XOR operation twice returns the original value.

- Signed and Unsigned Numbers:
  - [x] Comparison of signed and unsigned number.
  - [x] Negative numbers are stored as 2's compliment.
