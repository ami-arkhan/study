## Learn:
- In desktop pc's numbers are stored as little endian. That is least significant bytes are stored at the beginning. But in network numbers are stored as big endian. The is most significant butes are stored at the beginning.
  - [x] 0x1234 => 34 12 (little endian)
  - [x] 0x1234 => 12 34 (big endian)

- Converting from little endian to big endian and vice-versa.

- Twice XOR operation returns the original value.

- Exchanging values without temporary variable.

- Negative numbers are stored as 2's compliment. Comparison of signed and unsigned number.
