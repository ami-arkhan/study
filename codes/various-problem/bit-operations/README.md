## Problem:
Read hexadecimal data and find decimal sum of each 7-bit binary number from hexadecimal number. Hexadecimal numbers are given as such that when whole string is converted to binary it will be multiple of 7-bits.

Input string is given as hexadecimal numbers. Numbers ranging from 0 ~ 9 and English capital letters ranging from A ~ F are used.

Input hexadecimal numbers are multiple of binary 7-bits and ranges from 7 ~ 700 bits.
