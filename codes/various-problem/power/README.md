## Learn:
- Divide and Conquer: Problem is divided into 2 parts and each part is solved.

- Problem solving methods: 
  - [x] Iterative: Iteration is equal to power.
  - [x] Recursion: Each part is recursively called to solve. Recursive call extremely high as each divide part is called recursively.
  - [ ] Dynamic Programming: Store small sub-problems to solve bigger problem by reusing solution of smaller sub-problems. Recursive call is low. But as input 'Power' is higher, array memory location is NOT possible.



## Problem:
Find the power of a real number: Number<sup>Power</sup>.

Real number includes integers and fractional numbers.

10 < Power < 500000000



### Input:
20    // Total test cases

1.1 10    // Fractional Number, Power

1.1 20

1.1 30



### Output:
#1 2.59374    // #Test case number, Number ^ Power

#2 6.72750

#3 17.44940
