## Learn:
- Exhaustive searching method. Generate all subsets: 2<sup>n</sup>-1 subsets of case generated for n elements. Empty set is excluded. All subsets must be generated for this problem.

- Methods: Iterative and Recursive.

- Used elements marking with: 'array' and 'bits'.



## Problem:
Find number of sets in which sum of elements is zero and the maximum number of elements in those sets.



### Input:
20 // Total test cases

4   // Number of elements

1 -1 1 -2   // Elements

3

-2 -1 1

5

-6 -3 -2 -3 -4



### Output:
#1 3 3 // #Test case number, Number of possible sets, Maximum elements in those subsets

#2 1 2

#3 0 0
