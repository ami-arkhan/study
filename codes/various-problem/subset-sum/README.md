## Learn:
- Exhaustive searching method. Generate all subsets: 2<sup>n</sup>-1 subsets of case generated for n elements. Empty set is excluded. All subsets must be generated for this problem.

- Problem solving methods:
  - [x] Iterative.
  - [x] Recursive.

- Used elements marking with:
  - [x] Array.
  - [x] Bits.



## Problem:
Find the number of subsets in which sum of all elements of the set except empty set is zero and the largest number of elements from those subsets.

Maximum number of elements: 20.



### Input:
20 // Total test cases

4   // Number of elements

1 -1 1 -2   // Elements

3

-2 -1 1

5

-6 -3 -2 -3 -4



### Output:
#1 3 3 // #Test case number, Number of possible sets, Largest number of elements in those subsets

#2 1 2

#3 0 0
